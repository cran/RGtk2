\description{Moves the given \code{iter} forward by one display (wrapped) line.  A
display line is different from a paragraph. Paragraphs are
separated by newlines or other paragraph separator characters.
Display lines are created by line-wrapping a paragraph.  If
wrapping is turned off, display lines and paragraphs will be the
same. Display lines are divided differently for each view, since
they depend on the view's width; paragraphs are the same in all
views, since they depend on the contents of the \code{\link{GtkTextBuffer}}.}
