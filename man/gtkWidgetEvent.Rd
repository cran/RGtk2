\description{Rarely-used function. This function is used to emit
the event signals on a widget (those signals should never
be emitted without using this function to do so).
If you want to synthesize an event though, don't use this function;
instead, use \code{\link{gtkMainDoEvent}} so the event will behave as if
it were in the event queue. Don't synthesize expose events; instead,
use \code{\link{gdkWindowInvalidateRect}} to invalidate a region of the
window.}
\usage{gtkWidgetEvent(object, event)}
\arguments{
\item{\code{object}}{[\code{\link{GtkWidget}}]  a \code{\link{GtkWidget}}}
\item{\code{event}}{[\code{\link{GdkEvent}}]  a \code{\link{GdkEvent}}}
}
\value{[logical]  return from the event signal emission (\code{TRUE} if the event was handled)}
