\title{gtkWindowSetKeepAbove}
\description{Asks to keep \code{window} above, so that it stays on top. Note that
you shouldn't assume the window is definitely above afterward,
because other entities (e.g. the user or window manager) could not keep it above,
and not all window managers support keeping windows above. But
normally the window will end kept above. Just don't write code
that crashes if not.}
\usage{gtkWindowSetKeepAbove(object, setting)}
\arguments{
\item{\code{object}}{[\code{\link{GtkWindow}}]  a \code{\link{GtkWindow}}}
\item{\code{setting}}{[logical]  whether to keep \code{window} above other windows}
}
\details{It's permitted to call this function before showing a window,
in which case the window will be kept above when it appears onscreen
initially.
  
You can track the above state via the "window\_state\_event" signal
on \code{\link{GtkWidget}}.
  
Note that, according to the Extended Window 
Manager Hints (\url{http://www.org/Standards/wm-spec}) specification, the above state is mainly meant 
for user preferences and should not be used by applications e.g. for 
drawing attention to their dialogs.
