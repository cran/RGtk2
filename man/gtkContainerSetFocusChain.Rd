\description{Sets a focus chain, overriding the one computed automatically by GTK+.}
\usage{gtkContainerSetFocusChain(object, focusable.widgets)}
\arguments{
\item{\code{object}}{[\code{\link{GtkContainer}}]  a \code{\link{GtkContainer}}.}
\item{\code{focusable.widgets}}{[list]  the new focus chain.}
}
\details{In principle each widget in the chain should be a descendant of the 
container, but this is not enforced by this method, since it's allowed 
to set the focus chain before you pack the widgets, or have a widget 
in the chain that isn't always packed. The necessary checks are done 
when the focus chain is actually traversed.  }
