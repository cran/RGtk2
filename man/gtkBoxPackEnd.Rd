\description{Adds \code{child} to \code{box}, packed with reference to the end of \code{box}.  The
\code{child} is packed after (away from end of) any other child packed with reference to the
end of \code{box}.}
\usage{gtkBoxPackEnd(object, child, expand = TRUE, fill = TRUE, padding = 0)}
\arguments{
\item{\code{object}}{[\code{\link{GtkBox}}] a \code{\link{GtkBox}}.}
\item{\code{child}}{[\code{\link{GtkWidget}}] the \code{\link{GtkWidget}} to be added to \code{box}.}
\item{\code{expand}}{[logical] \code{TRUE} if the new child is to be given extra space allocated to
\code{box}.  The extra space will be divided evenly between all children of
\code{box} that use this option.}
\item{\code{fill}}{[logical] \code{TRUE} if space given to \code{child} by the \code{expand} option is
actually allocated to \code{child}, rather than just padding it.  This
parameter has no effect if \code{expand} is set to \code{FALSE}.  A child is
always allocated the full height of a \code{\link{GtkHBox}} and the full width of a
\code{\link{GtkVBox}}.  This option affects the other dimension.}
\item{\code{padding}}{[numeric] extra space in pixels to put between this child and its
neighbors, over and above the global amount specified by
\code{spacing} in \code{\link{GtkBox}}.  If \code{child} is a
widget at one of the reference ends of \code{box}, then \code{padding} pixels are also put
between \code{child} and the reference edge of \code{box}.}
