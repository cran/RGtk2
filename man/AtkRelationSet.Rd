\section{Detailed Description}{The AtkRelationSet held by an object establishes its relationships with
objects beyond the normal "parent/child" hierarchical relationships that all
user interface objects have.  AtkRelationSets establish whether objects are
labelled or controlled by other components, share group membership with other
components (for instance within a radio-button group), or share content which
"flows" between them, among other types of possible relationships.}
