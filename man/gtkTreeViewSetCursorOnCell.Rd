\description{Sets the current keyboard focus to be at \code{path}, and selects it.  This is
useful when you want to focus the user's attention on a particular row.  If
\code{focus.column} is not \code{NULL}, then focus is given to the column specified by
it. If \code{focus.column} and \code{focus.cell} are not \code{NULL}, and \code{focus.column}
contains 2 or more editable or activatable cells, then focus is given to
the cell specified by \code{focus.cell}. Additionally, if \code{focus.column} is
specified, and \code{start.editing} is \code{TRUE}, then editing should be started in
the specified cell.  This function is often followed by
\code{gtk.widget.grab.focus} (\code{tree.view}) in order to give keyboard focus to the
widget.  Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is
realized.}
