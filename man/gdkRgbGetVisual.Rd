\description{Gets a "preferred visual" chosen by GdkRGB for rendering image data
on the default screen. In previous versions of GDK, this was the
only visual GdkRGB could use for rendering. In current versions,
it's simply the visual GdkRGB would have chosen as the optimal one
in those previous versions. GdkRGB can now render to drawables with
any visual.}
