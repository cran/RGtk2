\description{Dialog windows should be set transient for the main application
window they were spawned from. This allows window managers to e.g. keep the
dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the
main window. \code{\link{gtkDialogNewWithButtons}} and other convenience
functions in GTK+ will sometimes call
\code{\link{gtkWindowSetTransientFor}} on your behalf.}
\usage{gtkWindowSetTransientFor(object, parent = NULL)}
\arguments{
\item{\code{object}}{[\code{\link{GtkWindow}}]  a \code{\link{GtkWindow}}}
\item{\code{parent}}{[\code{\link{GtkWindow}}]  parent window}
}
\details{On Windows, this function will and put the child window
on top of the parent, much as the window manager would have
done on X.  }
