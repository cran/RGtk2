\title{gdkPixbufLoaderGetAnimation}
\description{Queries the \verb{\link{GdkPixbufAnimation}} that a pixbuf loader is currently creating.
In general it only makes sense to call this function after the "area_prepared"
signal has been emitted by the loader. If the loader doesn't have enough
bytes yet (hasn't emitted the "area_prepared" signal) this function will 
return \code{NULL}.}
\usage{gdkPixbufLoaderGetAnimation(object)}
\arguments{\item{\verb{object}}{[\verb{\link{GdkPixbufLoader}}]  A pixbuf loader}}
\value{[\verb{\link{GdkPixbufAnimation}}]  The \verb{\link{GdkPixbufAnimation}} that the loader is loading, or \code{NULL} if
 not enough data has been read to determine the information.}
