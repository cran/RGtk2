\description{Saves pixbuf to a new buffer in format \code{type}, which is currently "jpeg",
"png", "tiff", "ico" or "bmp".  This is a convenience function that uses
\code{\link{gdkPixbufSaveToCallback}} to do the real work. Note that the buffer 
is not and may contain embedded  nuls.
If \code{error} is set, \code{FALSE} will be returned and \code{string} will be set to
\code{NULL}. Possible errors include those in the \code{GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR}
domain.}
