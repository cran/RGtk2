\title{gtkWidgetPath}
\description{Obtains the full path to \code{widget}. The path is simply the name of a
widget and all its parents in the container hierarchy, separated by
periods. The name of a widget comes from
\code{\link{gtkWidgetGetName}}. Paths are used to apply styles to a widget
in gtkrc configuration files.  Widget names are the type of the
widget by default (e.g. "GtkButton") or can be set to an
application-specific value with \code{\link{gtkWidgetSetName}}.  By setting
the name of a widget, you allow users or theme authors to apply
styles to that specific widget in their gtkrc
file. \code{path.reversed.p} fills in the path in reverse order,
i.e. starting with \code{widget}'s name instead of starting with the name
of \code{widget}'s outermost ancestor.}
