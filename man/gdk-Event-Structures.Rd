\description{Data structures specific to each type of event}
\section{Detailed Description}{The event structs contain data specific to each type of event in GDK.
  \strong{PLEASE NOTE:} A common mistake is to forget to set the event mask of a widget so that the
required events are received. See \code{\link{gtkWidgetSetEvents}}.}
\section{Structures}{\describe{
\item{\verb{GdkEventAny}}{
Contains the fields which are common to all event structs.
Any event pointer can safely be cast to a pointer to a \code{\link{GdkEventAny}} to access
these fields.

\describe{
\item{\verb{type}}{[\code{\link{GdkEventType}}] the type of the event.}
\item{\verb{window}}{[\code{\link{GdkWindow}}] the window which received the event.}
\item{\verb{sendEvent}}{[raw] \code{TRUE} if the event was sent explicitly (e.g. using
\code{xsendevent}).}
}

}
\item{\verb{GdkEventKey}}{
Describes a key press or key release event.

\describe{
\item{\verb{type}}{[\code{\link{GdkEventType}}] the type of the event (\code{GDK_KEY_PRESS} or \code{GDK_KEY_RELEASE}).}
\item{\verb{window}}{[\code{\link{GdkWindow}}] the window which received the event.}
\item{\verb{sendEvent}}{[raw] \code{TRUE} if the event was sent explicitly (e.g. using
\code{xsendevent}).}
\item{\verb{time}}{[numeric] the time of the event in milliseconds.}
\item{\verb{state}}{[numeric] a bit-mask representing the state of the modifier keys (e.g. Control,
Shift and Alt) and the pointer buttons. See \code{\link{GdkModifierType}}.}
\item{\verb{keyval}}{[numeric] the key that was pressed or released. See the
\file{<gdk/gdkkeysyms.h>}
header file for a complete list of GDK key codes.}
\item{\verb{length}}{[integer] the length of \code{string}.}
\item{\verb{string}}{[character] a string containing the an approximation of the text that
would result from this keypress. The only correct way to handle text
input of text is using input methods (see \code{\link{GtkIMContext}}), so this
field is deprecated and should never be used.
(\code{\link{gdkUnicodeToKeyval}} provides a non-deprecated way of getting
an approximate translation for a key.) The string is encoded in the encoding
of the current locale (Note: this for backwards compatibility:
strings in GTK+ and GDK are typically in UTF-8.) and NUL-terminated.
In some cases, the translation of the key code will be a single
NUL byte, in which case looking at \code{length} is necessary to distinguish
it from the an empty translation.}
\item{\verb{hardwareKeycode}}{[integer] the raw code of the key that was pressed or released.}
\item{\verb{group}}{[raw] the keyboard group.}
}

}
\item{\verb{GdkEventButton}}{
Used for button press and button release events. The
\code{type} field will be one of \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS},
\code{GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS}, \code{GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS}, and \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}.
  
Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received.
For double-clicks the order of events will be:
\enumerate{
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}
}
Note that the first click is received just like a normal
button press, while the second click results in a \code{GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS} being
received just after the \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}.
  
Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that \code{GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS}
is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is:
\enumerate{
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS}
\item \code{GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE}
}
  
For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of
a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press
must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.

\describe{
\item{\verb{type}}{[\code{\link{GdkEventType}}] the type of the event (\code{GDK_BUTTON_PRESS}, \code{GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS},

can also cause \code{\link{GdkEventGrabBroken}} events.
