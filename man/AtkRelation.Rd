\section{Detailed Description}{An AtkRelation describes a relation between an object and one or more
other objects. The actual relations that an object has with other objects
are defined as an AtkRelationSet, which is a set of AtkRelations.}
\section{Structures}{\describe{\item{\verb{AtkRelation}}{
The AtkRelation structure should not be accessed directly.

\section{Convenient Construction}{\code{atkRelation} is the equivalent of \code{\link{atkRelationNew}}.}
\section{Enums and Flags}{\describe{\item{\verb{AtkRelationType}}{
Describes the type of the relation  

\describe{
\item{\verb{null}}{ Not used, represens "no relationship" or an error condition.}
\item{\verb{controlled-by}}{ Indicates an object controlled by one or more target objects.}
\item{\verb{controller-for}}{ Indicates an object is an controller for one or more target objects.}
\item{\verb{label-for}}{ Indicates an object is a label for one or more target objects.}
\item{\verb{labelled-by}}{ Indicates an object is labelled by one or more target objects.}
\item{\verb{member-of}}{ Indicates an object is a member of a group of one or more target objects.}
\item{\verb{node-child-of}}{ Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable which is displayed because a cell in the same column is expanded and identifies that cell.}
\item{\verb{flows-to}}{ Indicates that the object has content that flows logically to another
 AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).}
\item{\verb{flows-from}}{ Indicates that the object has content that flows logically from
 another AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).}
\item{\verb{subwindow-of}}{ Indicates a subwindow attached to a component but otherwise has no connection in  the UI heirarchy to that component.}
\item{\verb{embeds}}{ Indicates that the object visually embeds 
 another object's content, i.e. this object's content flows around 
 another's content.}
\item{\verb{embedded-by}}{ Inverse of \code{ATK_RELATION_EMBEDS}, indicates that
 this object's content is visualy embedded in another object.}
\item{\verb{popup-for}}{ Indicates that an object is a popup for another object.}
\item{\verb{parent-window-of}}{ Indicates that an object is a parent window of another object.}
\item{\verb{description-for}}{ Indicates that another object provides descriptive information about this object; more verbose than ATK_RELATION_LABELLED_BY.}
\item{\verb{described-by}}{ Indicates that an object provides descriptive information about another object; more verbose than ATK_RELATION_LABEL_FOR.}
\item{\verb{last-defined}}{ Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable and is expanded to display other cells in the same column.}
