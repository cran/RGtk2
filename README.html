This RGtk package provides functionality in R for creating GUIs using
the Gtk toolkit that is used in the Gnome desktop and numerous
applications such as Gnumeric, AbiWord, GGobi.  One can create the
physical appearance in R and specify R functions or expressions as
callbacks that are invoked when the user interacts with the GUI.

<p>

The package provides access to the Gtk, Gdk, ATK, Pango, and GLib libraries.
It also has optional support for GtkMozEmbed and libglade.
Additionally, there are several other Gtk-related packages
that provide additional or add-on widgets. See the
http://www.omegahat.org/RGtk page for a list of available packages.

<p>

The bindings in this and other R Gtk-related packages are
auto-generated using the RGtkBindingGenerator package. This generates
both the S and C code that correspond to the Gtk types and routines.
